## Purpose of AI in AgriTech

In AgriTech, Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in helping **cooperatives** make smarter, faster, and more informed decisions when sourcing machines from suppliers.
Rather than relying on manual judgment or random choices, the AI system analyzes a range of data to recommend the **best suppliers** based on:

- Historical delivery performance
- Machine quality and condition reports
- Supplier reliability
- Timeliness of past deliveries
- Extension officer feedback from the field

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   The system gathers real-time and historical data from machine records, supplier logs, feedback reports, and IoT tracking history.

2. **Evaluation Model**
   A lightweight AI model (Agentic AI) processes this data to rank suppliers based on machine quality, field performance, and overall reliability.

3. **Recommendation**
   When a cooperative receives a farmer’s request, the AI suggests the top 1–3 suppliers most likely to meet quality, speed, and reliability needs.
   
4. **Learning Over Time**
   The more data it gathers, the smarter the system gets. For example, if one supplier’s machines consistently break down or arrive late, their ranking is adjusted accordingly.

## Future Improvements

In future releases, the AI system may include:

- Automated fraud detection in supplier entries
- Natural language query handling (e.g., "Find best supplier for dry season")
